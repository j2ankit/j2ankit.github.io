My group at TIGS studies the nervous systems of flies and mosquitoes. The nervous system of insects is complex. It consists of hundreds of thousands of neurons that make intricate and specific connections with each other. We want to understand how this complexity is accurately achieved during development, and ultimately, how it gives rise to behaviour.
